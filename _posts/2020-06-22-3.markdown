I upload this post in 06-22 but it was done around 02-20.

It was my first time to use open api.
I used weather api and google static maps api.

Input city name (ex seoul) to use below page!

I tried to use google maps javascript api, by changing codes in static maps api.

But it didn't work and I found that to use google mapas javascript api in vue.js,
you need to install package named vue-google-maps or make your own from the bottom.
