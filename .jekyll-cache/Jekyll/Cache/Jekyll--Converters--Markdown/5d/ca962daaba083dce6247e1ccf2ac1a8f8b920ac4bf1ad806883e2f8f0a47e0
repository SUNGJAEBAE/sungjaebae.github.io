I"b<p>I upload this post in 06-22 but it was done around 02-20.</p>

<p>It was my first time to use open api.
I used weather api and google static maps api.</p>

<p>Input city name (ex seoul) to use below page!</p>

<p>I tried to use google maps javascript api, by changing codes in static maps api.</p>

<p>But it didnâ€™t work and I found that to use google mapas javascript api in vue.js,
you need to install package named vue-google-maps or make your own from the bottom.</p>
